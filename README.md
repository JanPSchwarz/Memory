# Frontend Mentor - Memory App

This is a solution to the [Memory game challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/memory-game-vse4WFPvM). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Frontend Mentor provided me with professional Figma Designs.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the Memory game either solo or multiplayer (up to 4 players)
- Set the theme to use numbers or icons within the tiles
- Choose to play on either a 6x6 or 4x4 grid

I added some extra features on my behalf:

- animations for visuality and haptic feedback
- custom loading screen
- confirm messages before leaving/restarting game for UX
- logic for randomised Icons dynamically picked out of a library of more than 1600 items
